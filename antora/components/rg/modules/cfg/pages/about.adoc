= Core Configuration Properties
include::_attributes.adoc[]


Apache Isis' own configuration properties are simple key-value pairs, typically held in the `WEBINF/isis.properties`
file and other related files.
This guide describes how to configure an Apache Isis application.

[NOTE]
====
This guide covers only the core configuration properties (relating to Apache Isis' metamodel and runtime management).
Configuration properties for the viewers can be found in the xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket Viewer] guide and the xref:ug:vro:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] guide.
Likewise details of configuring security (Apache Shiro) can be
found in the xref:ug:sec:ugsec.adoc#[Security] guide, and details for configuring the DataNucleus Object Store can be found in the xref:ug:odn:ugodn.adoc#[DataNucleus] guide.
====

[TIP]
====
By default the configuration values are part of the built WAR file.
Details on how to override these configuration properties externally for different environments can be found in the xref:ug:btb:ugbtb.adoc#deployment[Beyond the Basics] guide, (deployment chapter).
