The name of classes and class members are usually inferred from the Java source code directly.
For example, an action method called `placeOrder` will be rendered as "Place Order", and a collection called `orderItems` is rendered as "Order Items".

Occasionally though the desired name is not possible; either the name is a Java reserved word (eg "class"), or might require characters that are not valid, for example abbreviations.

In such cases the name can be specified declaratively.

It is also possible to specify a description declaratively; this is used as a tooltip in the UI.

The table below summarizes the annotations available:

[TIP]
====
If you're running on Java 8, then note that it's possible to write Isis applications without using `@ParameterLayout(named=...)` annotation.
Support for this can be found in the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s paraname8 metamodel extension (non-ASF).
(In the future we'll fold this into core).

See also our guidance on xref:downloads:mn:migration-notes.adoc#upgrading-to-java8[upgrading to Java 8].

The framework also supports i18n: locale-specific names and descriptions.
For more information, see the xref:ug:btb:ugbtb.adoc#i18n[beyond-the-basics] guide.
