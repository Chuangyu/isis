By default all domain services are considered to be singletons, and thread-safe.

Sometimes though a service's lifetime is applicable only to a single request; in other words it is request-scoped.

The CDI annotation xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-RequestScoped[`@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`] is used to indicate this fact:

[source,java]
----
@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped
public class MyService extends AbstractService {
    ...
}
----

The framework provides a number of request-scoped services, include a xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_Scratchpad[`Scratchpad`] service query results caching through the xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_QueryResultsCache[`QueryResultsCache`], and support for co-ordinating bulk actions through the xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#ActionInvocationContext[`ActionInvocationContext`] service.  See the xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#[domain services] reference guide for further details.
